# Physics-Problem-Solver
***
### What it does
To help students check their answers, and teachers explain concepts, I collaborated with a partner to create a physics problem solver. This project is an interactive problem solver for nay variable included in projectile problems (with and without approximate consideration of air resistance) as well as the same for vertical dynamics problems, and inclined plane problems. 
### Building
Java was used to create the program after planning documents (use case diagram, gantt chart, and flowchart) were created using LucidChart.
### Challenges
The main problem that we had to overcome was solving for angles in projectile problems. To overcome, we had to break down the problem into smaller segments that we were able to figure out mathematically on pen and paper and then recombine all the smaller segments in code. Doing so allowed us to realize that there are multiple possible angles for the projectile to exist at, so by breaking down the problem into digestible pieces, we were not only able to overcome the problem, but we also considered new perpspectives we hadn't before. 
### Notable Features
The option to calculate angles required for particlar 
Memory system allowing to recall the last 3 answers
Different authorities for users to control originally static variables commonly invovled in problems
Interprets integer values for direction depending on nature of the questions previously answered
